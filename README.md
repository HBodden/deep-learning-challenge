# deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup has requested a tool that can assist in the selection of applicants for funding. The requirement is for the model to identify candidates with the best chance of success in their ventures. 

The task, using recently acquired knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, apply these concepts in the provided Alphabet Soup to identify and use the features to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
